The Haxe extension exposes an API that can be used by other VSCode extensions. Externs for this API can be found in the [`vshaxe` Haxelib](https://lib.haxe.org/p/vshaxe/) (`haxelib install vshaxe`). For more information, check out [the Haxelib's Readme](https://github.com/vshaxe/vshaxe/blob/master/README-haxelib.md#vshaxe).
