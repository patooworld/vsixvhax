There are three ways to use "Go to Definition" on an identifier:

- Click while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>:

- Use the context menu:

- Press <kbd>F12</kbd>

You can use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>◄</kbd> to navigate back to the original file (and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>►</kbd> to navigate back to the definition again if you already forgot what you were looking for).

**Known issues:** "Go to Definition" does not always work on `inline` variables ([haxe#5999](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues/5999)).
