When a Code Action is available for the current selection / cursor position, this is indicated by a light bulb to the left of the editor:

[[images/code-actions/light-bulb.png]]

To show the available actions, either click the light bulb or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd>. This will open a popup menu:

In case you want to change the default shortcut, the `command` for this keybinding is `"editor.action.quickFix"`.

In the following sections, we will showcase all Code Actions that are associated with [Diagnostics](/vshaxe/vshaxe/wiki/Diagnostics). There are also some Code Actions for [Code Generation](/vshaxe/vshaxe/wiki/Code-Generation), please refer to that page for details on those.
