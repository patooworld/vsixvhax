Through [Document Symbols](https://github.com/vshaxe/vshaxe/wiki/Document-Symbols), the Haxe extensions also adds support for VSCode's built-in Outline view. It can be opened with the `File: Focus on Outline` command:

The outline can be configured to automatically follow your cursor as you move through the document:

You might also want to consider switching to `Sort By: Position` for symbols to be listed in the same order as they appear in the source file.
