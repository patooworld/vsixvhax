"Peek Definition" is a more "lightweight" version of [Go to Definition](/vshaxe/vshaxe/wiki/Go-to-Definition). It shows you the definition in a hover hint rather than opening a new file or changing the location in the current one.

The easiest way to use "Peek Definition" is hovering over an identifier while <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is held down:

If you use the context menu or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>, the definition is expanded inline in the current document:
