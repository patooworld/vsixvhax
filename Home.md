Welcome to the vshaxe Wiki! To get started, check out the "Setup" section to the right, beginning with [Installation](/vshaxe/vshaxe/wiki/Installation).

Here, you can also find a comprehensive list of the different supported features, so you might discover a hidden gem or two (like [Code Lens](/vshaxe/vshaxe/wiki/Code-Lens)).

For anything that is not specific to vshaxe, check out the [official VSCode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).

Happy coding!
