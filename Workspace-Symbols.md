"Workspace Symbols" are the big brother of [Document Symbols](/vshaxe/vshaxe/wiki/Document-Symbols). They allow you to search your entire project for symbols, including Haxelib dependencies or the standard library. The default keybinding is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>, but you can also reach it via `Go` -> `Go to Symbol in Workspace...`.
